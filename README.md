=============

I really love this documentary / art installation called _Can I Get An Amen?_ by
Nate Harrison about the history of the Amen Break. I highly recommend
[watching it](http://archive.org/details/NateHarrisonCanIGetAnAmen).

One late, coffee-fueled night at Music Hack Day London around 3AM after I had 
given up on my first hack, I decided I wanted to write my own drum machine to be
played in the browser. The half-baked result, only working in one browser 
(Firefox on OSX to be precise) was [deployed to Heroku](http://vic-acid.heroku.com/).
I didn't even present it because it's just kind of silly, but was very fun to 
create.

This is the just the JavaScript portion of that page. I didn't include the drum
samples because, well, you'll understand when you watch the documentary.

Amen, brother.
