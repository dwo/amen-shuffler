=============

I really love this documentary / art installation called _Can I Get An Amen?_ by Nate Harrison about the history of the Amen Break.
I highly recommend [watching it](http://archive.org/details/NateHarrisonCanIGetAnAmen).
At one point, he mentions a now-defunct online radio station which he says will "[massage you] with endless permutations of the Amen Break.".

One late, coffee-fueled night at Music Hack Day London around 3AM after I had given up on my first hack, I decided I wanted to write my own Amen Break permutator.
The half-baked result, only working in one browser (Firefox on OSX to be precise) was [deployed to Heroku](http://vic-acid.herokuapp.com/).
I didn't even present it because it's just kind of silly, but it was very fun to create anyway.

This is the just the JavaScript portion of that page.
I didn't include the drum samples because, well, you'll understand when you watch the documentary.

Amen, brother.
